# GA Scheduler

Genetic Algorithm scheduler for assigning people to timeslots

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

I recommend installing [Anaconda for Python 3.6](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to handle the above.
* [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html)
